AI Mobile Phishing Detector App (Working Title: "PhishShield AI")
💡 Core Idea:

A mobile app that uses AI to analyze text messages, emails, and social media DMs in real time to detect phishing, scam links, and social engineering attacks — before the user clicks on anything risky.
🔍 How AI Powers It:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    Trains on phishing vs. legit messages.

    Flags suspicious patterns like:

        Urgency ("act now", "click fast")

        Reward scams ("you won a gift card")

        Spoofed sender language

        Grammatical patterns typical in scams

2. Link Analysis (ML + Threat Feeds)

    Scans embedded links using:

        AI threat models trained to detect malicious URLs

        Third-party threat intel APIs (like VirusTotal)

        Heuristics for shady redirects or domain spoofing

3. Real-Time AI Alerts

    Pushes warnings like:

        “⚠️ This message looks like a phishing scam. Don’t click the link.” “🔗 This link redirects to a known malicious website.”

4. Context-Aware Suggestions

    Auto-highlights parts of the message that triggered the warning

    Offers safe next steps like:

        “Mark as spam”

        “Report to IT”

        “Forward to cybersecurity team”
